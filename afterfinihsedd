As you pick it up, memories of your adventure rush through your mind. The challenges, the friendships forged, and the sacrifices made all come flooding back. \n A voice echoes, recounting your choices and their consequences. You're presented with a choice one last time: to use the artifact for power or to return it to its rightful place. Your decision shapes the world's destiny.")
